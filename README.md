# ImageEnhancementScript
This Python script allows users to enhance an image by adjusting various factors such as brightness, contrast, saturation, and sharpness. Users can either customize these settings or use default values. The image modifications are applied sequentially, and the final enhanced image is saved as "output_image.jpg".
